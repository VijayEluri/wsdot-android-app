=================

The [WSDOT Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gov.wa.wsdot.android.wsdot&hl=en) contains traffic and travel information for the state of
Washington. The app includes statewide traffic cameras and high priority travel
alerts, mountain pass reports, northbound Canadian border wait times, ferry
schedules and alerts as well as real time ferry locations.

This app is written in Java using the <a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/studio/index.html">Android Studio IDE</a>.

The code is not meant to illustrate best practices nor is it necessarily bug
free. It is by no means static and is actively being updated and improved upon.
